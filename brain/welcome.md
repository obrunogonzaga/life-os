# Welcome to life-os

Your personal Second Brain system.

## Philosophy

> If something is important enough to remember, it must become a document.

This system is designed to be your **knowledge architect**, not just a note-taking app.

## Quick Start

1. Add documents to `/brain` folder
2. Use frontmatter for metadata
3. Build your knowledge graph over time

## Document Types

- **concept** — Mental models, frameworks
- **decision** — Strategic choices and reasoning
- **journal** — Daily reflections
- **note** — Quick captures
- **reference** — External knowledge

Happy documenting! 🧠
